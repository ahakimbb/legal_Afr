In 2017, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) received more than 440,000 new applications for the trademark.

The annual report for the Fiscal Year 2017 also revealed that USPTO took approximately 16.3 months to complete patent average first action pendency (a period from the filing of an application to an initial office action) and 24.2 months to perform patent average total pendency (a period from the application filing to issued or abandoned patent).

A bulk of Intellectual Property (IP) Filings have to undergo a manual review which is a long-tail and time-consuming process. It is not only difficult to register new IP, but also to transfer ownership and update filings.

Due to the lengthy approval process, it becomes challenging to examine who created the IP first.

Blockchain can bring disruption to the handling of patents and trademarks by reducing approval wait times and required resources.

Here’s how the blockchain based solution for intellectual property (IP) management could work
a. Content Creators sign up into the platform

Content creators who want to get their creative work patented would have to sign up to the blockchain based platform for IP management and to upload intellectual property on the blockchain.

Creators sign up to the platform with the following information

Name
Contact information
Address
Date of Birth
Designation
Since the personal information will be stored on the blockchain, there is no chance of data disclosure without the user’s consent.

b. Content Creators upload IP on the blockchain network

After signing up to the platform successfully, the next step is to add an intellectual property for which a patent application needs to be filed. The content creators can upload the information related to IP on the blockchain network.

While adding Intellectual Property to the blockchain, a content creator needs to enter the following information

Title
Name of author
Name of owner
Classification (Category)
Keywords
Abstract
After inputting the above information, a content creator can upload their intellectual property. Saving it on the blockchain enables traceability and auditability to prevent data from manipulation or duplicity.

Once the intellectual property is added to the blockchain, it can be made visible to all other members of the network, without the possibility of alteration.

c. Content consumers requesting to consume the digital content

Content consumers willing to utilize the digital content would also have to register to the platform for accessing it.

They would also sign up to the platform in a similar way to the content creators.

Once the profile is created, the content consumers can request creators to utilize the digital content for a specific purpose.

Before a creator approves the request, the smart contracts would only enable consumers to access the details like the name of the owner, ratings, and abstract.

Content consumers would have to pay fees in specific tokens or fiat money to consume the entire original information published by the content creator.

After the creator approves the request, an NDA agreement is signed between them and content consumers.

The agreement is stored on the blockchain to ensure that the consumer agrees to the terms and conditions and to eliminate the need for maintaining paper files.

d. Copyright entities(lawyers) solving the disputes with the help of blockchain

Whether a user wants to establish proof of the authorship, share confidential information with partners, transfer IP rights, or decide to make a defensive publication, copyright entities can help solve various types of disputes with the help of the blockchain.

Imagine someone has used one line from the poet’s poem as a new slogan for their company without the creator’s consent. A few months later, the poem’s creator reads an advertisement and finds a line written by him. Then, he decides to approach that company.

If the organization claims the line as their new creation, the content creator may consult the lawyer.

Instead of fixing the appointment with a lawyer, they can provide lawyers the access to the original publication stored on the blockchain.

Due to the potential of blockchain to save time-stamped and auditable records, a lawyer can quickly prove whether the organization is falsifying or not.
